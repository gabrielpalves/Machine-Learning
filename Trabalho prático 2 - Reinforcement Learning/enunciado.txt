For this project, you will implement and analyse:

1) Value iteration for a grid-world (Question 1)
2) Q-Learning from scratch for Example 6.6: Cliff Walking from the Sutton & Barto book (page 132).
3) Q-Learning for PacMan (Questions 6, 7 and Question 9)

Among other things, you will:
- describe the MDP (state space, action space, reward function, environment dynamics)
- deliver the implemented code
- show the plot of the rewards during training episodes and experiment with the parameters of the algorithms.
